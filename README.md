<h1>Sign Language Gesture Detection and Translation</h1>
<p>This project is an interactive user interface (UI)-enabled machine learning (ML) model designed to detect and translate sign language gestures in real-time. Leveraging Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), the system processes live camera feed to recognize and interpret various sign language gestures accurately.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
        <li><strong>Real-time Detection:</strong> The model operates in real-time, providing instant feedback on sign language gestures as they are performed.</li>
        <li><strong>UI Integration:</strong> The interactive user interface allows users to observe the detected gestures conveniently, enhancing the user experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-Gesture Recognition:</strong> Capable of recognizing a wide range of sign language gestures, making it versatile and adaptable to different sign languages.</li>
        <li><strong>Translation Capabilities:</strong> Once a gesture is detected, the system translates it into text or speech, enabling communication with non-signers.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

<ul>
        <li><strong>Support Vector Machines (SVM):</strong> Employed for classification tasks to distinguish between different sign language gestures.</li>
        <li><strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):</strong> Utilized for feature extraction and pattern recognition in the image data from the camera feed.</li>
        <li><strong>Python:</strong> The primary programming language used for model development and implementation.</li>
        <li><strong>OpenCV:</strong> Integrated for capturing and processing live video feed from the camera.</li>
        <li><strong>TensorFlow / PyTorch:</strong> Frameworks used for building and training the CNN model.</li>
    </ul>
